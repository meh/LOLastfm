From 0.3 you need Perl supporting threads if you want to use some functions.

Those functions are optional anyway so if you don't need them don't worry.

--
# perl -MCPAN -e shell
cpan> install Net::LastFM::Submission
--

And then you can |make install| it (as root) :)

LOLastfm -h for the options or use the /etc/init.d/LOLastfm (only for Gentoo and runscript compliant distros)

If you use MPD you need to do:
--
# perl -MCPAN -e shell
cpan> install Audio::MPD
--

Services:

current - this service permits to get current song informations through sockets at a given port, needs IO::Socket and JSON to be installed.
